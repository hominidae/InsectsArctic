First, you will need to download the data. I've used 7Zip to compress the data I and others at ARCBIO collected.

It is attached to this repository as a 7Zip archive. However, since all of these data have relied on public funds the data is considered to be open source.

As a result, you can also download this data from BOLD via the public data portal by selecting "Nunavut" as a search term.

However, I suggest that you download the archive here instead because the public data available from BOLD is not sanitized. The introduction of errors as a result of data entry issues, poor field notes, errors in GPS coordinates, etc does result in problems during processing the data.
